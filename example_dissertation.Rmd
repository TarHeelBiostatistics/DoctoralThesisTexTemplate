# Introduction 

## Getting started

This is an example thesis .Rmd template, which, when compiled, uses the `template.tex` file to create both a `.tex` file and a `.pdf` file.

NOTE: `template.tex` is under development.

You can put custom definitions in a file to be included in the .tex header. For example, putting 
```
\def\cA{{\mathcal{A}}} 
```
in `example_header_include.tex`  allow you to type `\cA` in the text which, when compiled, yields: $\cA$. Change the filename as necessary but be sure to update the filename in the YAML header.

## Another thing

I have more to say such as, "I can put a table here"

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{This is my first table.}
\label{tab:1}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
$\sigma$ & $\theta$ \\
\hline \\
1.2 & 4 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

# My estimator beats your estimator

## Put all you work here

One could put all the text in a single `.Rmd` file.

## Or in separate files

```{r, child='example_child.Rmd'}
```

# How to cite

You can also cite other papers.

## rmarkdown syntax

You cite articles using `rmarkdown` syntax (google rmarkdown for helpful hints). For example, @halmos1970howto is a good text read. Or writing about mathematics is challenging [@halmos1970howto].
